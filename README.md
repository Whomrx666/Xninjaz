$ cd Xninjaz
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Xninjaz.py
```
## Features

- **LFI Scanner**: Detect Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities.
- **OR Scanner**: Identify Open Redirect vulnerabilities.
- **SQL Scanner**: Detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
- **XSS Scanner**: Identify Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
- **Multi-threaded scanning**: Improved performance through multi-threading.
- **Customizable payloads**: Adjust payloads to suit specific targets.
- **Success criteria**: Modify success detection criteria for specific use cases.
- **User-friendly command-line interface**: Simple and intuitive.
- **Save vulnerable URLs**: Option to save the results of vulnerable URLs to a file..

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- `webdriver_manager==4.0.2`
- `selenium==4.24.0`
- `aiohttp==3.10.5`
- `beautifulsoup4==4.12.3`

- `requests==2.28.1`

## Instructions
- **first**: Install tools according to the instructions above
- **second**: Select one of the columns you want to run
- **third**: Enter a custom path or single URL with the vulnerability that matches the column you selected
- **last**: Tools will automatically search for vulnerabilities 

## Input Information:
- **Input URL/File**: You can provide a single URL or an input file containing a list of URLs to scan.
- **Payload File**: Select or provide a custom payload file for the type of vulnerability you want to scan for.
- **Success Criteria:**:  Define the patterns or strings that indicate a successful exploitation attempt.
- **Concurrent Threads:**: Set the number of threads for multi-threaded scanning.
- **View and Save Results:**: Results will be displayed in real-time as the scan progresses.
